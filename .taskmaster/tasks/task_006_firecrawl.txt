# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement configuration management system for scraping profiles
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a configuration management system that enables creation and management of scraping profiles for Google CodeLabs and other dynamic sites, supporting customizable JavaScript execution timeouts, content filtering, and site-specific optimizations.
# Details:
Design and implement a configuration management module (e.g., config_manager.py) that allows users to define, store, and retrieve scraping profiles for various target sites. Each profile should support settings such as JavaScript execution timeout, content filtering rules (e.g., CSS selectors, keywords), and site-specific scraping options (e.g., user agent, delay, proxy usage). Use a structured format (YAML or JSON) for profile definitions, and provide functions to load, validate, and update profiles at runtime. Integrate with the scraping workflow so that the correct profile is applied based on the target domain. Ensure extensibility for future site-specific parameters. Consider security best practices for handling sensitive configuration data (e.g., API keys, credentials) by supporting environment variable overrides or encrypted storage. Provide sample profiles for Google CodeLabs and at least one other dynamic site, demonstrating customization of JavaScript timeouts and content filters. Document the configuration schema and usage examples.

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests to verify correct loading, validation, and updating of configuration profiles from disk and environment variables. 2. Test that site-specific settings (e.g., JavaScript timeout, content filters) are correctly applied during scraping for Google CodeLabs and another dynamic site. 3. Simulate invalid or missing configuration scenarios to ensure robust error handling and fallback behavior. 4. Verify that sensitive data is not exposed in logs or error messages. 5. Confirm that the system supports adding new site profiles without code changes, using only configuration files.
