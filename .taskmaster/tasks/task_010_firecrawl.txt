# Task ID: 10
# Title: Develop Monitoring and Analytics Dashboard for Scraping Operations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a comprehensive dashboard to monitor scraping statistics, track success and failure rates, assess content quality, monitor performance, and analyze usage for project oversight.
# Details:
Design and build a monitoring and analytics dashboard using Streamlit or a suitable web framework. Integrate real-time and historical data collection for key metrics: (1) scraping statistics (total jobs, jobs per domain, frequency), (2) success/failure tracking (per URL, per batch, error types), (3) content quality metrics (markdown structure, code block preservation, link integrity, AI-readiness scores), (4) performance monitoring (latency, throughput, resource usage), and (5) usage analytics (active users, most scraped domains, batch sizes). Store metrics in a persistent backend (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, or cloud database). Visualize data with interactive charts, tables, and filters for time ranges and domains. Ensure the dashboard updates in near real-time, leveraging event-driven updates or periodic polling. Provide export options (CSV/JSON) for analytics data. Consider extensibility for future metrics and compliance with privacy requirements. Reference best practices for dashboard design and web scraping monitoring[1][2].

# Test Strategy:
1. Simulate scraping operations with a mix of successful and failed jobs, verifying that all metrics (counts, rates, error types) are accurately captured and displayed. 2. Validate real-time updates by triggering new jobs and confirming dashboard refresh. 3. Check content quality metrics by processing known markdown samples and ensuring scores/flags are correct. 4. Test performance metrics by running batch jobs and monitoring latency and throughput visualizations. 5. Confirm usage analytics reflect actual user and domain activity. 6. Export analytics data and verify file contents. 7. Conduct UI/UX review for clarity, responsiveness, and usability.
