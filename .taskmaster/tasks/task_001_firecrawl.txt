# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up project foundation with Streamlit interface and Firecrawl dependencies
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish the initial project structure, create a basic Streamlit interface with a URL input field, and configure requirements.txt for Firecrawl integration.
# Details:
1. Create the following directory structure at the project root: 'streamlit-app/', 'data/', and 'config/'.
2. Inside 'streamlit-app/', create an 'app.py' file that initializes a basic Streamlit application. Use 'import streamlit as st' and add a title and a text input field for URL entry using 'st.text_input("Enter URL")'.
3. Optionally, use 'st.form' for batching input if you plan to expand the form later, as per Streamlit best practices[4].
4. In the project root, create a 'requirements.txt' file listing all necessary dependencies, including 'streamlit' and any packages required for Firecrawl integration (e.g., 'firecrawl', 'requests', etc.).
5. Ensure all files are placed in their respective directories and that the structure is clean and ready for further development.

# Test Strategy:
- Verify that the directory structure ('streamlit-app/', 'data/', 'config/') exists and contains the correct files.
- Run 'streamlit run streamlit-app/app.py' and confirm that the app launches with a visible title and a URL input field.
- Enter a URL in the input field and ensure the value is captured (e.g., print or display it on the page).
- Check that 'requirements.txt' includes all necessary dependencies and that running 'pip install -r requirements.txt' completes without errors.
