# Task ID: 11
# Title: Create Comprehensive Project Documentation Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop a complete documentation suite including a user manual, setup guide, API documentation, troubleshooting guide, and contribution guidelines to ensure maintainability and facilitate user adoption.
# Details:
1. Establish a centralized documentation repository (e.g., /docs directory) and select a documentation toolchain (such as Markdown, Sphinx, or MkDocs) for consistency and ease of maintenance.
2. User Manual: Write clear, step-by-step instructions for all user-facing features, including navigation, content processing, file management, and dashboard usage. Include annotated screenshots and example workflows.
3. Setup Guide: Provide detailed installation and configuration steps for all environments (local, production, self-hosted), covering prerequisites, dependency installation, environment variables, and initial project launch. Include troubleshooting for common setup issues.
4. API Documentation: Document all public APIs and modules (e.g., firecrawl_client.py, data_processor.py, file_manager.py), including endpoint descriptions, input/output schemas, authentication, usage examples, and error codes. Use auto-generation tools where possible and supplement with usage scenarios.
5. Troubleshooting Guide: List common errors, failure scenarios, and their resolutions for both end-users and developers. Include error messages, log locations, and escalation steps.
6. Contribution Guidelines: Define standards for code style, branching, pull requests, testing, and documentation updates. Provide onboarding steps for new contributors and a code of conduct.
7. Ensure all documentation is versioned, includes a revision history, and is accessible from the main project interface. Use diagrams and flowcharts to illustrate architecture and workflows where appropriate.

# Test Strategy:
1. Review each documentation section for completeness, clarity, and technical accuracy by conducting peer reviews with both developers and non-technical users.
2. Follow the setup guide on a clean environment to verify reproducibility and resolve any ambiguities.
3. Use API documentation to implement sample integrations and confirm all endpoints and examples are correct.
4. Simulate common user and developer issues using the troubleshooting guide to ensure solutions are actionable.
5. Validate that contribution guidelines are followed by submitting a test pull request and reviewing the onboarding process.
6. Confirm all documentation is accessible, up-to-date, and versioned appropriately.
