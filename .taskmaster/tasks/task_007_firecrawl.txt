# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement comprehensive error handling and retry logic for scraping operations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Add robust error handling with user-friendly messages, automatic retry mechanisms (up to 3 attempts), detailed logging, and graceful degradation for JavaScript-heavy sites in the scraping workflow.
# Details:
Integrate comprehensive error handling throughout the scraping and crawling modules by wrapping all network and JavaScript execution operations in try/catch/finally blocks. For each operation, catch and classify errors (e.g., network errors, timeouts, JavaScript execution failures) using built-in and custom error types. Implement an automatic retry mechanism that attempts failed operations up to three times with exponential backoff. Ensure that all errors are logged with detailed context (error type, message, stack trace, affected URL, and attempt number) using a centralized logging utility. For user-facing components, display clear, actionable error messages without exposing sensitive details. For JavaScript-heavy sites that fail after retries, implement graceful degradation by returning partial results or fallback content, and flag these cases in the output. Ensure that error handling logic is consistent across both synchronous and asynchronous (batch) operations, and that it integrates with the configuration management system for site-specific error handling policies.

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit and integration tests to simulate various error scenarios (network failures, timeouts, JavaScript errors, invalid URLs) and verify that errors are caught, logged, and retried up to three times. 2. Confirm that user-facing messages are clear and appropriate for each error type. 3. Test that batch processing correctly handles partial failures and continues processing remaining URLs. 4. Validate that logs contain sufficient detail for debugging. 5. For JavaScript-heavy sites, simulate persistent failures and verify that graceful degradation returns fallback content and flags the result appropriately. 6. Test configuration overrides for error handling and retry policies per site profile.
