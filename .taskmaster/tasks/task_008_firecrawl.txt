# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Comprehensive Automated Testing Suite for Content Extraction and Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement an automated testing suite that validates the full extraction and processing pipeline, including Google CodeLabs URLs, markdown output quality for AI consumption, batch processing, and JavaScript-rendered content extraction.
# Details:
Design and implement a robust testing suite using pytest (or a similar framework) to cover the end-to-end workflow. Key components:
- **Primary Test URLs:** Select a representative set of Google CodeLabs and other dynamic/static URLs as fixtures. Ensure coverage of both simple and JavaScript-heavy pages.
- **Markdown Output Validation:** After extraction and processing, compare markdown output against expected results. Validate structure, code block preservation, link formatting, and AI-readiness (e.g., readability, context retention). Use snapshot testing for markdown outputs to catch regressions.
- **Batch Processing:** Simulate batch jobs with mixed valid/invalid URLs. Assert correct parallel execution, progress tracking, and error handling. Ensure results are aggregated and failures are reported clearly.
- **JavaScript-rendered Content:** For dynamic sites, verify that JavaScript-executed content is fully extracted (e.g., using Puppeteer or Firecrawl's JS support). Compare extracted data to ground truth or visible page content. Include tests for timeouts and partial loads.
- **Integration Points:** Mock or stub external dependencies (e.g., network, file system) where appropriate, but include full integration tests for critical paths.
- **Regression and Edge Cases:** Add tests for malformed markdown, broken links, duplicate content, and large documents. Ensure the suite is easily extensible for new sites and formats.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run the suite against a curated list of Google CodeLabs and dynamic URLs, verifying extraction completeness and markdown output matches expected snapshots.
2. For each test, assert that code blocks, links, and formatting are preserved and optimized for LLM consumption.
3. Execute batch processing tests with mixed URL validity, confirming correct concurrency, progress updates, and error reporting.
4. For JavaScript-rendered pages, compare extracted content to manual page inspection or known ground truth, ensuring dynamic elements are captured.
5. Simulate edge cases (timeouts, malformed input, duplicates) and verify graceful handling and accurate reporting.
6. Review test coverage reports to ensure all major modules and workflows are exercised.
