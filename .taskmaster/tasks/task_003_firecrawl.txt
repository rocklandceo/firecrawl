# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop content processing module with markdown optimization and AI-friendly formatting
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create data_processor.py to optimize markdown content, preserve code blocks, process links, and format text for LLM consumption.
# Details:
Implement a Python module named data_processor.py that provides functions or a class for processing and optimizing markdown content. Key features should include: (1) Markdown optimization—refine document structure, enforce style consistency, and improve readability using context-aware formatting; (2) Code block preservation—detect and retain fenced code blocks (triple backticks), optionally applying language detection and syntax highlighting metadata for downstream use; (3) Link processing—identify, validate, and if necessary, rewrite or annotate internal and external links for clarity and SEO; (4) AI-friendly formatting—ensure output is structured for large language model (LLM) consumption, such as clear section headers, semantic hierarchy, and removal of extraneous markdown artifacts. Consider leveraging Python-Markdown and relevant extensions (e.g., fenced_code, syntax highlighting) for robust parsing and transformation. Provide a clear API for processing raw markdown input and returning optimized output. Include comprehensive docstrings and usage examples.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests covering: (1) preservation and correct formatting of fenced code blocks with various languages; (2) markdown structure optimization (e.g., heading normalization, list formatting); (3) correct identification and processing of links, including edge cases (broken, relative, or malformed links); (4) output formatting suitable for LLM input (e.g., no broken markdown, consistent style). Use sample markdown files with mixed content (text, code, links) as test fixtures. Verify that processed output matches expected results and that code blocks remain intact. Include tests for error handling and malformed input.
